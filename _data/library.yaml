    title: Seven Brief Lessons On Physics
    authors: Rovelli, Carlo
    isbn: 9780399184413
    publisher: Riverhead Books
    edition: Hardcover
    notes: "'Here, on the edge of what we know, in contact with the ocean of the unknown, shines the mystery and the beauty of the world. And it's breathtaking'  These seven short, simple lessons guide us through the scientific revolution that shook physics in the twentieth century and still continues to shake us today. Theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli, a founder of the loop quantum gravity theory. explains Einstein's theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics, black holes, the complex architecture of the universe, elementary particles, gravity, and the nature of the mind. In under eighty pages, readers will understand the most transformative scientific discoveries of the twentieth century and what they mean for us.'\n\nThe last chapter is the most eye opening. Rovelli equates man's nature to that of the beasts and any other part of nature we might imagine.\n\nHis comments about not being able to grant any a priori principals is interesting.\n\nWith that in mind he has taken for granted (as a priori) the theory of evolution and applied it's principals to his thinkings which are driving his conclusions."

    title: Work And Our Labor in the Lord
    authors: Hamilton, James M. Jr.
    isbn:
    publisher: Crossway
    edition: Paperback
    notes: "I would almost give this a 4 star review  as the author did a good job talking to the earth as God's tabernacle. However, his eschatology has lead to a radical disconnect between the OT tabernacle \"tutors\" and the new creation....which we are in, and which we are currently building and  taking dominion over. With the disconnect the worker is left with only a gnostic spiritual hope for work....after death they will get their crow, their work is only spiritually evangelical and proclaimitory  . ...but it's all really just sound and fury, signifying nothing.

    title: Why We Sleep, Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams
    authors: Walker, Matthew
    isbn: 977-1-5011-4432-5
    publisher: Simon and Schuster
    edition: Paperback
    notes: "I really enjoyed reading this book. The author is not Christian, but his observations have a lot of marit and I've thought much more about my sleep and valuing it. Putting a more Biblical view on sleep it becomes evident  that sleep is Regenerative and death to life in Christ in His created order. Also thinking of how the Sun rules the day and in doing so rules man's circadian rhythm is a wonderful thought."
